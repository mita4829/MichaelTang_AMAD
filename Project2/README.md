<ul>
  <b><li>Description of your app including your app's inspiration and goal.</li></b>
  I will be making a game where the user has to determine the image that's on the screen is a cat or a hat. The user has to determine this within a fraction of a second, or else the user will lose. This app is inspired from the original Duck or Llama game. 
  <b><li>Define your app's intended audience. Who will be using your app? What problem is your app solving for them?</li></b>
 The intended audience is anyone, and it does not solve a problem. I want to make the app playable enough that people can be competitive.  
  <b><li>Do some research -- do similar apps exist? If so, how will yours be better or different? Research enough to know that what you're proposing is possible.</li></b>
 Duck or Llama is the app that exist within the AppStore; my app will be different in that the theme will be cats and hats. 
  <b><li>Where will you get any content needed for your app? This could include text, formulas, whatever your app requires.</li></b>
 I will use images of cats and hats on Google Images.
