# Milestone 1

<ul>
  <b><li>Description of your app including your app's inspiration and goal.</li></b>
  I will be making a reminder list app using tableViews and persistent data with property lists. I will also be experimenting with the camera. My goal is to have the 
  app be able to take photos of hand-written text, recognize the written characters, and save it as a reminder. The inspriation come from my
  current computer vision class where we're learning algorithms to detect features in images, and I want to make my own text-recognition algorithm. <i>Scary hard</i>, but <b>fun...</b>. 
  <b><li>Define your app's intended audience. Who will be using your app? What problem is your app solving for them?</li></b>
  The hopeful intended audience is people who don't feel like typing out the reminder when the reminder is already written on paper. The user should just be able to take of picture of it, and the app
  will recongize the text and save the reminder as text. I will be using this app, and I will share my work also with my other classmates in my computer vision class. This app is not solving any problem as it's just
  experimenting with text recognition. 
  <b><li>Do some research -- do similar apps exist? If so, how will yours be better or different? Research enough to know that what you're proposing is possible.</li></b>
  Google translate has the feature of optical character recognition (OCR) of translating image text to another language; however, it does not have the reminder function as that will be different. 
  <b><li>Where will you get any content needed for your app? This could include text, formulas, whatever your app requires.</li></b>
  I will be photoshopping all needed images/buttons/icons. The mathematical formulas and algorithms will come from resources in my computer vision class.
